# Firefox for Android (Fenix Project)

Firefox for Android is Mozilla's new browser for Android devices. Powered by GeckoView and built on Android Components, Fenix is a pilot for early adopters, developers, and anyone who wants to help make a better, more private Firefox for Android.

Firefox for Android is the first step in building a better mobile browser: one thatâ€™s faster, more secure and more independent than any mobile Firefox browser before it. It will combine the speed, privacy, control, and easy-to-use features you have come to expect from Firefox.
