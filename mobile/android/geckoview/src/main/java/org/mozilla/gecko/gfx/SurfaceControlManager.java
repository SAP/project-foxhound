// A helper class that creates Surfaces from SurfaceControl objects, for the widget to render in to.
// Unlike the Surfaces provided to the widget directly from the application, these are suitable for
// use in the GPU process as well as the main process.
//
// The reason we must not render directly in to the Surface provided by the application from the GPU
// process is because of a bug on Android versions 12 and later: when the GPU process dies the
// Surface is not detached from the dead process' EGL surface, and any subsequent attempts to
// attach another EGL surface to the Surface will fail.
//
// The application is therefore required to provide the SurfaceControl object to a GeckoDisplay
// whenever rendering in to a SurfaceView. The widget will then obtain a Surface from that
// SurfaceControl using getChildSurface(). Internally, this creates another SurfaceControl as a
// child of the provided SurfaceControl, then creates the Surface from that child. If the GPU
// process dies we are able to simply destroy and recreate the child SurfaceControl objects, thereby
// avoiding the bug.
