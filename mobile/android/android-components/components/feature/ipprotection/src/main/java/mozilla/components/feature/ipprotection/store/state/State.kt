/**
 * Represents the lifecycle of the FxA account as it pertains to the IP protection service.
 *
 * We have a separation of authentication and authorization so that we can decide which scopes or services to use.
 * With FxA today, a device will have the VPN scope included in the authorization flow, where-as in current Android
 * code, we do not have Sync decoupled from FxA, so we need to authenticate with the VPN and Sync scopes. For this
 * reason, we have divergant flows.
 *
 * To avoid re-requesting an auth flow, we have the intermediary (UI) states `Needs*`, `Requesting*`, and `Awaiting*`:
 *
 * A user is prompted to auth with the [NeedsAuthorization] and [NeedsAuthentication]. We get here when the
 * [mozilla.components.feature.ipprotection.store.IPProtectionStore] deduces that our engine requires a
 * valid auth token to proceed.
 *
 * An observers use the [RequestingAuthorization] and [RequestingAuthentication] states to know we need to initiated an
 * auth flow. The observers are typically some form of UI driver that needs to trigger the flow.
 *
 * A user can leave an incomplete flow at any time in the UI, in which case we need to return to the top of the
 * previous branch. The [AwaitingAuthorization] and [AwaitingAuthorization] let us do this.
 *
 * Whether the flow is successful or not, we try to end with [AwaitingEnrollment]. If we received this event with a
 * result from the account manager, then we can move forward with [AuthFailed] or [Ready], otherwise, we go back into
 * the `Needs*` state for each branch.
 *
 * The optional [TryAgain] is typically used to re-notify the engine that we have an account in a valid auth state
 * and it's safe to re-request an access token, if needed.
