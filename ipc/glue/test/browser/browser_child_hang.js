// Try to open a tab.  This provides code coverage for a few things,
// although currently there's no automated functional test of correctness:
//
// * On opt builds, when the tab is closed and the process exits, it
//   will hang for 3s and the parent will kill it after 2s.
//
// * On debug[*] builds, the parent process will wait until the
//   process exits normally; but also, on browser shutdown, the
//   preallocated content processes will block parent shutdown in
//   WillDestroyCurrentMessageLoop.
//
// [*] Also sanitizer and code coverage builds.
