Utility Process
===============

.. warning::
  Please reach out to #ipc on https://chat.mozilla.org/ if you intent to add a new utility.

The utility process is used to provide a simple way to implement IPC actor with
some more specific sandboxing properties, in case where you don't need or want
to deal with the extra complexity of adding a whole new process type but you
just want to apply different sandboxing policies.
To implement such an actor, you will have to follow a few steps like for
implementing the trivial example visible in `EmptyUtil
<https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D126402>`_:

  - Define a new IPC actor, e.g., ``PEmptyUtil`` that allows to get some string
    via ``GetSomeString()`` from the child to the parent

  - In the ``PUtilityProcess`` definition, expose a new child-level method,
    e.g., ``StartEmptyUtilService(Endpoint<PEmptyUtilChild>)``

  - Implement ``EmptyUtilChild`` and ``EmptyUtilParent`` classes both deriving
    from their ``PEmptyUtilXX``. If you want or need to run things from a
    different thread, you can have a look at ``UtilityProcessGenericActor``

  - Make sure both are refcounted

  - Expose your new service on ``UtilityProcessManager`` with a method
    performing the heavy lifting of starting your process, you can take
    inspiration from ``StartEmptyUtil()`` in the sample.

  - Ideally, this starting method should rely on :searchfox:`StartUtility() <mozilla-central/rev/f9f9b422f685244dcd3f6826b70d34a496ce5853:ipc/glue/UtilityProcessManager.cpp#238-318,347>`

  - To use ``StartUtility()`` mentioned above, please ensure that you provide
    a ``nsresult BindToUtilityProcess(RefPtr<UtilityProcessParent>
    aUtilityParent)``. Usually, it should be in charge of creating a set of
    endpoints and performing ``Bind()`` to setup the IPC. You can see some example for :searchfox:`UtilityMediaService <mozilla-central/rev/0fe32133f12ed0f20d5fde8fe970157f04817982:ipc/glue/UtilityMediaServiceChild.cpp#60-92>`

  - For proper user-facing exposition in ``about:processes`` you will have to also provide an actor
    name via a method ``UtilityActorName GetActorName() { return UtilityActorName::EmptyUtil; }``

    + Add member within :searchfox:`enum WebIDLUtilityActorName in <mozilla-central/rev/f9f9b422f685244dcd3f6826b70d34a496ce5853:dom/chrome-webidl/ChromeUtils.webidl#852-866>`

  - Handle reception of ``StartEmptyUtilService`` on the child side of
    ``UtilityProcess`` within ``RecvStartEmptyUtilService()``

  - In ``UtilityProcessChild::ActorDestroy``, release any resources that
    you stored a reference to in ``RecvStartEmptyUtilService()``.  This
    will probably include a reference to the ``EmptyUtilChild``.

  - The specific sandboxing requirements can be implemented by tracking
    ``SandboxingKind``, and it starts within :searchfox:`UtilityProcessSandboxing header <ipc/glue/UtilityProcessSandboxing.h>`

  - Try and make sure you at least add some ``gtest`` coverage of your new
    actor, for example like in :searchfox:`existing gtest <ipc/glue/test/gtest/TestUtilityProcess.cpp>`

  - Also ensure actual sandbox testing within

    + ``SandboxTest`` to start your new process,
      :searchfox:`security/sandbox/common/test/SandboxTest.cpp`

    + ``SandboxTestingChildTests`` to define the test
      :searchfox:`security/sandbox/common/test/SandboxTestingChildTests.h`

    + ``SandboxTestingChild`` to run your test
      :searchfox:`security/sandbox/common/test/SandboxTestingChild.cpp`

  - Please also consider having a look at :ref:`Process Bookkeeping <process-bookkeeping>` for anything you may want to ensure is supported by your new process, like e.g. profiler, crash reporting, etc.
