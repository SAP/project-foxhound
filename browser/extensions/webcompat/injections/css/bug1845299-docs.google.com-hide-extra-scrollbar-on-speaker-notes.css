/**
 * docs.google.com/presentation - speaker notes area has an extra vertical scrollbar
 * Bug #1845299 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1845299
 *
 * They are using non-standard webkit-scrollbar CSS to hide the scrollbar, but also
 * add overflow-y:scroll, so it is always visible. We can use overflow-y:auto instead.
