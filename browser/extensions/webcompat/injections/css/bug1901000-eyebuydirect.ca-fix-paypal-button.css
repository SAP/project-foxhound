 * eyebuydirect.ca - PayPal button is unclickable
 * Bug #1901000 - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1901000
 * WebCompat issue #137777 - https://github.com/webcompat/web-bugs/issues/137777
 *
 * The site uses Zoid components for the PayPal button, which gives opacity:0 to
 * its containing element, which makes it unclickable in Firefox. We should be able
 * to simply remove that opacity:0 for now.
