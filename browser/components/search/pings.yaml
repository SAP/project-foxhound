    A ping representing a "This time, search with" event with a partner search.
    Does not contain a `client_id`, preferring a `context_id` instead.
    The `context_id` is used internally for counting unique sers as well as for
    anti-fraud. It is shared with other Contextual Services. It is not shared
    externally.
