# About Welcome

## Overview
The About Welcome page is a full-screen, multi-step onboarding experience that appears for most new users after successfully installing Firefox. Exceptions include users on Enterprise builds or custom configurations where this experience is disabled on first startup.

The onboarding experience on `about:welcome` displays screens in the following precedence order:
- Has AMO attribution
  - [Return to AMO](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/browser/components/asrouter/docs/first-run.html#return-to-amo-rtamo) custom onboarding screens
- Experiments
- `MR_ABOUT_WELCOME_DEFAULT` [screens](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3b707c8fd7e978eebf24279ee51ccf07895cfbcb/browser/components/newtab/aboutwelcome/lib/AboutWelcomeDefaults.jsm#523) selected by dynamic rules inside the [prepareContentForReact](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3b707c8fd7e978eebf24279ee51ccf07895cfbcb/browser/components/newtab/aboutwelcome/lib/AboutWelcomeDefaults.jsm#577) method. Each screen's visibility can be dynamically configured through the screen-level targeting ([see example](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/3b707c8fd7e978eebf24279ee51ccf07895cfbcb/browser/components/newtab/aboutwelcome/lib/AboutWelcomeDefaults.jsm#90)).

The [Spotlight messaging surface](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/browser/components/asrouter/docs/spotlight.html) can be configured to show `about:welcome` screens in a modal format by using [exposed window.AW* interfaces](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/spotlight.js#28-47). These interfaces expose top level functions expected by the About Welcome bundle and allow for custom handling as needed. This [Unified Onboarding](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o8W-gEkgw2GC7KFSfQRkKfWzNJg1-6fpkVPrYmmot4Y/edit) approach enables reusing `about:welcome` as a rendering engine for multiple messaging surfaces such as Spotlight and [Feature Callout](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/browser/components/asrouter/docs/feature-callout.html).

## Testing about:welcome Screens

### Testing with the Screens Pref
1. Go to `about:config`, search for the `browser.aboutwelcome.screens` pref and set it to the array of screen values to be used in a JSON recipe.
2. Go to about:welcome and you should see the newly configured screen(s)

**Note:** If you are enrolled in an About Welcome nimbus experiment, the screens you set in the pref will not appear. You can see your current enrollments at `about:studies`.

### Testing with Experiments
You can test custom `about:welcome` UI by creating an experiment. [Messaging Journey](https://experimenter.info/messaging/desktop-messaging-journey) captures creating and testing experiments via Nimbus. Note that test experiments should be created in the Nimbus [staging environment](https://stage.experimenter.nonprod.webservices.mozgcp.net/nimbus/), not in production.
