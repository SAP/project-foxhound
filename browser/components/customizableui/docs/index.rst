CustomizableUI Component
========================

This component is responsible for managing and manipulating the default and
customized state of various UI surfaces in the browser. Most of the logic for
doing this resides in ``CustomizableUI``, but some responsibility is also
delegated to modules like ``CustomizableWidgets`` and ``CustomizeMode``.
