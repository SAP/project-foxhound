OverflowableToolbar
===================

The ``OverflowableToolbar`` class is used for toolbars that, upon shrinking
in width, can overflow their contents into an "overflow panel". In practice,
this is really only the browser navigation toolbar - though in times past, it
was possible to create multiple overflowable toolbars.
