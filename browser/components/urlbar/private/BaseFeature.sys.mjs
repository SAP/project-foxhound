/**
 * Base class for quick suggest features. It can be extended to implement a
 * feature that is part of the larger quick suggest feature and that should be
 * enabled only when quick suggest is enabled.
 *
 * You can extend this class as an alternative to implementing your feature
 * directly in `QuickSuggest`. Doing so has the following advantages:
 *
 * - If your feature is gated on a Nimbus variable or preference, `QuickSuggest`
 *   will manage its lifetime automatically. This is really only useful if the
 *   feature has state that must be initialized when the feature is enabled and
 *   uninitialized when it's disabled.
 *
 * - Encapsulation. You can keep all the code related to your feature in one
 *   place, without mixing it with unrelated code and cluttering up
 *   `QuickSuggest`. You can also test it in isolation from `QuickSuggest`.
 *
 * - Remote settings management. You can register your feature with
 *   `QuickSuggestRemoteSettings` and it will be called at appropriate times to
 *   sync from remote settings.
 *
 * - If your feature also serves suggestions from remote settings, you can
 *   implement one method, `queryRemoteSettings()`, to hook into
 *   `UrlbarProviderQuickSuggest`.
 *
 * - Your feature will automatically get its own logger.
 *
 * To register your subclass with `QuickSuggest`, add it to the `FEATURES` const
 * in QuickSuggest.sys.mjs.
