Firefox Suggest Telemetry
=========================

This document describes the telemetry that Firefox records for the Firefox
Suggest feature. That is, it describes Firefox Suggest telemetry recorded on the
client. It also discusses the data that Firefox sends to the Merino service.

For information on other telemetry related to the address bar, see the general
address bar :doc:`telemetry` document. For information on all telemetry in
Firefox, see the toolkit :doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/index` document.

Histograms
----------

The following histograms are recorded for Firefox Suggest. For general
information on histogram telemetry in Firefox, see the
:doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/collection/histograms` document.

FX_URLBAR_MERINO_LATENCY_MS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This histogram records the latency in milliseconds of the Merino source for
suggestions, or in other words, the time from Firefox's request to the Merino
server to the time Firefox receives a response. It is an exponential histogram
with 50 buckets and values between 0 and 30000 (0s and 30s).

Changelog
  Firefox 93.0
    Introduced. [Bug 1727799_]

.. _1727799: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1727799

FX_URLBAR_MERINO_LATENCY_WEATHER_MS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This histogram records the latency in milliseconds of weather suggestions from
Merino. It is updated in addition to ``FX_URLBAR_MERINO_LATENCY_MS`` and has the
same properties. It is an exponential histogram with 50 buckets and values
between 0 and 30000 (0s and 30s).

Changelog
  Firefox 110.0
    Introduced. [Bug 1804536_]

.. _1804536: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1804536

FX_URLBAR_MERINO_RESPONSE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This categorical histogram records a summary of each fetch from the Merino
server. It has the following categories:

:0 "success":
   The fetch completed without any error before the timeout elapsed and it
   included at least one suggestion. (Before Firefox 110.0, this category meant
   simply that the fetch completed without any error before the timeout elapsed
   regardless of whether it included any suggestions.)
:1 "timeout":
   The timeout elapsed before the fetch completed or otherwise failed.
:2 "network_error":
   The fetch failed due to a network error before the timeout elapsed. e.g., the
   user's network or the Merino server was down.
:3 "http_error":
   The fetch completed before the timeout elapsed but the server returned an
   error.
:4 "no_suggestion":
   The fetch completed without any error before the timeout elapsed and it did
   not include any suggestions.

Changelog
  Firefox 94.0.2
    Introduced. [Bug 1737923_]

  Firefox 110.0
    Added the ``no_suggestion`` category. The meaning of the ``success``
    category was changed from "The fetch completed without any error before the
    timeout elapsed" to "The fetch completed without any error before the
    timeout elapsed and it included at least one suggestion." [Bug 1804536_]

.. _1804536: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1804536

FX_URLBAR_MERINO_RESPONSE_WEATHER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This categorical histogram records a summary of each fetch for weather
suggestions from the Merino server. It is updated in addition to
``FX_URLBAR_MERINO_RESPONSE`` and has the same categories.

:0 "success":
   The fetch completed without any error before the timeout elapsed and it
   included at least one suggestion.
:1 "timeout":
   The timeout elapsed before the fetch completed or otherwise failed.
:2 "network_error":
   The fetch failed due to a network error before the timeout elapsed. e.g., the
   user's network or the Merino server was down.
:3 "http_error":
   The fetch completed before the timeout elapsed but the server returned an
   error.
:4 "no_suggestion":
   The fetch completed without any error before the timeout elapsed and it did
   not include any suggestions.

Changelog
  Firefox 110.0
    Introduced. [Bug 1804536_]

.. _1804536: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1804536

FX_URLBAR_QUICK_SUGGEST_REMOTE_SETTINGS_LATENCY_MS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This histogram records the latency in milliseconds of the remote settings source
for suggestions, or in other words, the time from when Firefox starts fetching a
suggestion from remote settings to the time the suggestion is retrieved. It is
an exponential histogram with 50 buckets and values between 0 and 30000 (0s and
30s).

Note that unlike Merino, fetches from remote settings happen entirely on the
client, so remote settings latencies are expected to be much smaller than Merino
latencies.

Changelog
  Firefox 94.0.2
    Introduced. [Bug 1737651_]

Scalars
-------

The following scalars are recorded for Firefox Suggest. For general information
on scalar telemetry in Firefox, see the
:doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/collection/scalars` document.

browser.ui.interaction.preferences_panePrivacy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This keyed scalar is incremented each time the user clicks a Firefox Suggest
checkbox or toggle switch in the preferences UI. Keys are the following:

:firefoxSuggestBestMatch:
  This key is incremented when the "Top pick" checkbox is clicked. In 120 this
  UI was removed, so this key is no longer recorded.

- The user has completed an engagement with the address bar by picking a result
  in it or by pressing the Enter key.
- At the time the user completed the engagement, a suggestion was present in the
  results.

Each key is the index at which a suggestion appeared in the results (1-based),
and the corresponding value is the number of impressions at that index.

contextual.services.quicksuggest.impression_sponsored_bestmatch
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This keyed scalar was removed in Firefox 120. Prior to that, it records
sponsored best match impressions. It is incremented each time the user is shown
a sponsored best match and the following two conditions hold:

- The user has completed an engagement with the address bar by picking a result
  in it or by pressing the Enter key.
- At the time the user completed the engagement, a sponsored best match was
  present in the results.

Each key is the index at which a suggestion appeared in the results (1-based),

Events
------

The following Firefox Suggest events are recorded in the
``contextservices.quicksuggest`` category. For general information on event
telemetry in Firefox, see the
:doc:`/toolkit/components/telemetry/collection/events` document.

contextservices.quicksuggest.data_collect_toggled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This event is recorded when the
``browser.urlbar.quicksuggest.dataCollection.enabled`` pref is toggled. The pref
can be toggled in the following ways:

- The user can toggle it in the preferences UI.
- The user can toggle it in about:config.

The event is also recorded when the user opts in to the online modal dialog,
with one exception: If the user has already enabled data collection using the
preferences UI or about:config, then the pref's user value is already
true. Opting in doesn't change the user value, so no event is recorded.

The event's objects are the following:

:enabled:
  Recorded when the pref is flipped from false to true.
:disabled:
  Recorded when the pref is flipped from true to false.

Changelog
  Firefox 94.0.2
    Introduced. [Bug 1735976_]

.. _1735976: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1735976

contextservices.quicksuggest.enable_toggled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This event is recorded when the
``browser.urlbar.suggest.quicksuggest.nonsponsored`` pref is toggled. The pref
can be toggled in the following ways:

- The user can toggle it in the preferences UI.
- The user can toggle it in about:config.

The event's objects are the following:

:enabled:
  Recorded when the pref is flipped from false to true.
:disabled:
  Recorded when the pref is flipped from true to false.

Changelog
  Firefox 87.0:
    Introduced. The event corresponds to the
    ``browser.urlbar.suggest.quicksuggest`` pref. [Bug 1693126_]

  Firefox 94.0.2:
    ``browser.urlbar.suggest.quicksuggest`` is replaced with
    ``browser.urlbar.suggest.quicksuggest.nonsponsored``, and this event now
    corresponds to the latter pref. [Bug 1735976_]

  Firefox 96.0:
    The event is no longer recorded when the user interacts with the online
    modal dialog since the ``browser.urlbar.suggest.quicksuggest.nonsponsored``
    pref is no longer set when the user opts in or out. [Bug 1740965_]

.. _1740965: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1740965

contextservices.quicksuggest.engagement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This event is recorded when an engagement occurs in the address bar while a
Firefox Suggest suggestion is present. In other words, it is recorded in two
cases:

- The user picks a Firefox Suggest suggestion or a related UI element like its
  help button.
- While a Firefox Suggest suggestion is present in the address bar, the user
  picks some other row.

The event's objects are the following possible values:

:block:
  The user dismissed ("blocked") the suggestion.
:click:
  The user picked the suggestion.
:help:
  The user picked the suggestion's help button.
:impression_only:
  The user picked some other row.
:other:
  The user engaged with the suggestion in some other way, for example by picking
  a command in the result menu. This is a catch-all category and going forward
  Glean telemetry should be preferred.

The event's ``extra`` contains the following properties:

:match_type:
  "best-match" if the suggestion was a best match or "firefox-suggest" if it was
  a non-best-match suggestion.
:position:
  The index of the suggestion in the list of results (1-based).
:suggestion_type:
  The type of suggestion, one of: "sponsored", "nonsponsored",
  "dynamic-wikipedia", "navigational"
:source:
  The source of suggestion, one of: "remote-settings", "merino"

Changelog

contextservices.quicksuggest.impression_cap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This event is recorded when an event related to an impression cap occurs. The
event's objects are the following possible values:

:hit:
  Recorded when an impression cap is hit.
:reset:
  Recorded when a cap's counter is reset because its interval period has
  elapsed. The implementation may batch multiple consecutive reset events for a
  cap in a single telemetry event; see the ``eventCount`` discussion below.
  Reset events are reported only when a cap's interval period elapses while
  Firefox is running.

The event's ``extra`` contains the following properties:

:count:
  The number of impressions during the cap's interval period.
:eventCount:
  The number of impression cap events reported in the telemetry event. This is
  necessary because the implementation may batch multiple consecutive "reset"
  events for a cap in a single telemetry event. When that occurs, this value
  will be greater than 1, ``startDate`` will be the timestamp at which the
  first event's interval period started, ``eventDate`` will be the timestamp at
  which the last event's interval period ended, and ``count`` will be the number
  of impressions during the first event's interval period. (The implementation
  guarantees that reset events are batched only when the number of impressions
  for all subsequent interval periods is zero.) For "hit" events,
  ``eventCount`` will always be 1.
:eventDate:
  The event's timestamp, in number of milliseconds since Unix epoch. For "reset"
  events, this is the timestamp at which the cap's interval period ended. If
  ``eventCount`` is greater than 1, it's the timestamp at which the last
  interval period ended. For "hit" events, this is the timestamp at which the
  cap was hit.
:impressionDate:
  The timestamp of the most recent impression, in number of milliseconds since
  Unix epoch.
:intervalSeconds:
  The number of seconds in the cap's interval period. For lifetime caps, this
  value will be "Infinity".
:maxCount:
  The maximum number of impressions allowed in the cap's interval period.
:startDate:
  The timestamp at which the cap's interval period started, in number of
  milliseconds since Unix epoch.
:type:
  The type of cap, one of: "sponsored", "nonsponsored"

Nimbus Exposure Event
---------------------

A `Nimbus exposure event`_ is recorded once per app session when the user first
encounters the UI of an experiment in which they're enrolled. The timing of the
event depends on the experiment and branch.

There are two Nimbus variables that determine the timing of the event:
``experimentType`` and the deprecated ``isBestMatchExperiment``. To determine
when the exposure event is recorded for a specific experiment and branch,
examine the experiment's recipe and look for one of these variables.

Listed below are the supported values of ``experimentType`` and
``isBestMatchExperiment`` along with details on when their corresponding
exposure events are recorded.

:experimentType = "best-match":
  If the user is in a treatment branch and they did not disable best match, the
  event is recorded the first time they trigger a best match; if the user is in
  a treatment branch and they did disable best match, the event is not recorded
  at all. If the user is in the control branch, the event is recorded the first
  time they would have triggered a best match. (Users in the control branch
  cannot "disable" best match since the feature is totally hidden from them.)
  NOTE: The "Top pick" checkbox, which allowed the user to disable best batch,
  was removed in 120.
:experimentType = "modal":
  If the user is in a treatment branch, the event is recorded when they are
  shown an opt-in modal. If the user is in the control branch, the event is
  recorded every time they would have been shown a modal, which is on every
  startup where another non-Suggest modal does not appear.
  NOTE: This has been removed in Firefox 124.
:isBestMatchExperiment = true:
  This is a deprecated version of ``experimentType == "best-match"``.
:All other experiments:
  For all other experiments not listed above, the event is recorded the first
  time the user triggers a Firefox Suggest suggestion.

Changelog
  Firefox 92.0
    Introduced. The event is always recorded the first time the user triggers
    a Firefox Suggest suggestion regardless of the experiment they are enrolled
    in. [Bug 1724076_, 1727392_]

  Firefox 99.0
    The ``isBestMatchExperiment = true`` case is added. [Bug 1752953_]

Merino Search Queries
---------------------

Merino is a Mozilla service that provides Firefox Suggest suggestions. Along
with remote settings on the client, it is one of two possible sources for
Firefox Suggest. When Merino integration is enabled on the client and the user
has opted in to Firefox Suggest data collection, Firefox sends everything the
user types in the address bar to the Merino server. In response, Merino finds
relevant search results from its search providers and sends them to Firefox,
where they are shown to the user in the address bar.

The user opts in to Firefox Suggest data collection when they either opt in to
the online modal dialog or they enable Firefox Suggest data collection in the
preferences UI.

Merino queries are not telemetry per se but we include them in this document
since they necessarily involve data collection.

Merino API
~~~~~~~~~~

Data that Firefox sends to the Merino server is summarized below. When Merino
integration is enabled on the client and the user has opted in to Firefox
Suggest data collection, this data is sent with every user keystroke in the
address bar.

For details on the Merino API, see the `Merino documentation`_.

.. _Merino documentation: https://mozilla-services.github.io/merino/api.html#suggest

Search Query
  The user's search query typed in the address bar.

  API parameter name: ``q``

Session ID
  A UUID that identifies the user's current search session in the address bar.
  This ID is unique per search session. A search session ends when the focus
  leaves the address bar or a timeout of 5 minutes elapses, whichever comes
  first.

  API parameter name: ``sid``

Sequence Number
  A zero-based integer that is incremented after a response is received from
  Merino. It is reset at the end of each search session along with the session
  ID.

  API parameter name: ``seq``

Client Variants
  Optional. A list of experiments or rollouts that are affecting the Firefox
  Suggest user experience. If Merino recognizes any of them, it will modify its
  behavior accordingly.

  API parameter name: ``client_variants``

Providers
  Optional. A list of providers to use for this request. If specified, only
  suggestions from the listed providers will be returned. Otherwise Merino will
  use a default set of providers.

  API parameter name: ``providers``
