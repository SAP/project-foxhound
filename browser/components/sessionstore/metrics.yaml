browser.engagement:
  sessionrestore_interstitial:
    type: labeled_counter
    description: >
      Whether we show about:sessionrestore or not. Split by key, which
      indicates why we showed the item or not. Specifically,
      'deferred_restore' means we didn't autorestore and thus didn't show
      the interstitial; 'autorestore' indicates we autorestored without
      showing the interstitial. 'shown_old_session',
      'shown_only_about_welcomeback', 'shown_many_crashes',
      'shown_many_crashes_old_session' all indicate we did show the
      interstitial because of a crash, and the text after 'shown'
      indicates what secondary reason there was to show this page (as we
      don't show it for 'just' one crash).
      This metric was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry
      scalar browser.engagement.sessionrestore_interstitial.
