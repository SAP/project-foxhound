Migration
=========

The migration component is responsible for bringing data from outside applications running on the same computer into Firefox. This is typically done via a wizard where users can choose what types of data to migrate over.

The migrator is also used during a "Profile Refresh" to pave over a newly created Firefox profile with some data from an older one.
