    # The "src/jsoncpp.cpp" file and the "src/json" directory can be skipped. OpenVR
    # uses the jsoncpp library, which we have already imported elsewhere. If
    # warnings about using deprecated jsoncpp classes show up during compilation
    # you might need to reapply the patch in bug 1598288. It replaces uses of the
    # `Json::Reader` and `Json::StyledWriter` classes with the more modern
    # `Json::CharReaderBuilder` and `Json::StreamWriterBuilder`.
