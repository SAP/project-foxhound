# This script exists to help with the rebase process on elm.  It rebases
# each patch individually to make it easier to fix rebase conflicts
# without jeopardizing earlier, sucessfully rebased commits. In order to
# limit rebase conflicts around generated moz.build files, it regenerates
# moz.build file commits.  It also ensures any commits with 'FLOAT' in the
# commit summary are pushed to the top of the fast-forward stack to help
# the sheriffs more easily merge our commit stack from elm to moz-central.
#
# Occasionally, there will be upstream vendored commits that break the
# build file generation with follow on commits that fix that error. In
# order to allow the rebase process to work more smoothly, it is possible
# to annotate a commit with the string '(skip-generation)' and normal
# build file generation (detected with changes to BUILD.gn files) is
# disabled for that commit.  The script outputs instructions for handling
# this situation.
#
# Note: the very first rebase operation may require some manual
# intervention. The user will need to provide, at minimum, the first
# commit of the fast-forward stack if the script is unable to determine
# it automatically.  Example:
#   MOZ_BOTTOM_FF=30f0afb7e4c5 \
#   bash dom/media/webrtc/third_party_build/elm_rebase.sh
#
# Assumes the top of the fast-forward stack to rebase is the current revision,
# ".".

GENERATION_ERROR=$"
Generating build files has failed.  The most common reason for this
failure is that the current commit has an upcoming '(fix-xxxxxx)' commit
that will then allow the build file generation to complete.  If the
current situation seems to fit that pattern, adding a line with
'(skip-generation)' to the commit message will ensure that future rebase
operations do not attempt to generate build files for this commit.  It may
be as simple as running the following commands:
  HGPLAIN=1 hg log -T '{desc}' -r tip > $TMP_DIR/commit_message.txt
  ed -s $TMP_DIR/commit_message.txt <<< $'3i\n(skip-generation)\n\n.\nw\nq'

Mercurial changes in third_party/libwebrtc since the last rebase have been

  mv mailbox.patch $MOZ_LIBWEBRTC_SRC
  (cd $MOZ_LIBWEBRTC_SRC && \\

When verify_vendoring.sh is successful, run the following in bash:
  (source $SCRIPT_DIR/use_config_env.sh ;
   ./mach python $SCRIPT_DIR/save_patch_stack.py \\
    --repo-path $MOZ_LIBWEBRTC_SRC \\
