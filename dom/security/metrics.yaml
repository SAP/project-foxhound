      Expected values are:

        - sanitizedWindowsPath - A filepath, on Windows, sanitized by WinUtils::PreparePathForTelemetry which is a bare filename or a subpath of %ProgramFiles%, %SystemRoot%, or %TEMP%
        - sanitizedWindowsURL - A partial URL, on Windows, consisting of either file://../ followed by the value prepared as for sanitizedWindowsPath, or the bare scheme of the original url
        - other - Unknown
        - other-on-worker - We cannot do a regex; it is not a chrome, resource, data, or blob uri, but could be any other.
        - regexfailure - Our Regex Matching code threw an error

      The fileinfo key may contain additional information about the file that
      caused the eval() depending on the above value. Resource, Chrome,
      About, and SingleString will contain the full value. (About URIs
      will remove any querystring values.)

      Extensions-from-file will contain the full value; however .xpi! will be shortened to !,

      UserChromeJS, Other, and Regexfailure should have no value.
