  Description:

  1. We visit http://example.com/A
  2. HTTPS-First upgrades to https://example.com/A
  3. https://example.com/A redirects us to http://example.com/B, because we
     visit it via https
  4. HTTPS-First fails to upgrade to https://example.com/B as it gets redirected
     back to http, which means we set an HTTPS-Only/First exception for
     "http://example.com"
  5. http://example.com/B sends HTML informing the user that HTTPS is not
     supported, and redirecting the user back to http://example.com/A via
     window.location = "...".
  6. The load to http://example.com/A will not be upgraded again
  7. Subsequent visits of http://example.com/A will also not be upgraded
