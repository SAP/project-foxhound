    //  2. The load gets upgraded via https-first and therefor sets the
    //     `HTTPS_ONLY_UPGRADED_HTTPS_FIRST`-flag on the nsILoadInfo
    //     from the channel. We load the https variant of the url:
    //     https://example.com/tests/dom/security/test/https-first/file_redirect_error.sjs?cross-302
    //  3. The server responds with a redirect with a different host, path and
    //     still the https-scheme, indicating that following errors are not a
    //     result of the https-first upgrade. When progressing the redirect,
    //     we clear the `HTTPS_ONLY_UPGRADED_HTTPS_FIRST`-flag. We continue
    //     with loading the resulting URL:
    //     https://example.net/tests/dom/security/test/https-first/file_redirect_error.sjs?verify
    //  4. We display the error returned by the server and not downgrade to
    //     http-version.

    //     https://example.com/tests/dom/security/test/https-first/file_redirect_error.sjs?downgrade
    //  3. The server responds with an redirect to the http version of the

    //     http version we exempt example.com from loading securely.
