  JSON.isRawJSON ( O )

  18 ECMAScript Standard Built-in Objects
  ...
  Unless specified otherwise, a built-in object that is callable as a function
  is a built-in function object with the characteristics described in 10.3.
  Unless specified otherwise, the [[Extensible]] internal slot of a built-in
  object initially has the value true. Every built-in function object has a
  [[Realm]] internal slot whose value is the Realm Record of the realm for
  which the object was initially created.
  ...
  Unless otherwise specified every built-in function and every built-in
  constructor has the Function prototype object, which is the initial value of
  the expression Function.prototype (20.2.3), as the value of its [[Prototype]]
  internal slot.
  ...
  Built-in function objects that are not identified as constructors do not
  implement the [[Construct]] internal method unless otherwise specified in the
  description of a particular function.
