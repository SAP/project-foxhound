// [SMDOC] CacheIR Health Report
//
// The goal of CacheIR health report is to make the costlier
// CacheIR stubs more apparent and easier to diagnose.
// This is done by using the scores assigned to different CacheIROps in
// CacheIROps.yaml (see the description of cost_estimate in the
// aforementioned file for how these scores are determined), summing
// the score of each op generated for a particular stub together, and displaying
// this score for each stub in an inline cache. The higher the total stub score,
// the more expensive the stub is.
//
// There are a few ways to generate a health report for a script:
// 1. Simply running a JS program with the evironment variable
//    SPEW=RateMyCacheIR. We generate a health report for a script whenever we
//    reach the trial inlining threshold.
//      ex) SPEW=RateMyCacheIR dist/bin/js jsprogram.js
// 2. In the shell you can call rateMyCacheIR() with no arguments and a report
//    will be generated for all scripts in the current zone.
//      ex) rateMyCacheIR()
// 3. You may also call rateMyCacheIR() on a particular function to see the
//    health report associated with that function's script.
//      ex) rateMyCacheIR(foo)
//
// Once you have generated a health report, you may go to
// https://carolinecullen.github.io/cacheirhealthreport/ to visualize the data
// and aid in understanding what may be going wrong with the CacheIR for a
// particular stub. For more information about the tool and why a particular
// script, inline cache entry, or stub is unhappy go to:
// https://carolinecullen.github.io/cacheirhealthreport/info.html
