/*
 * How to taint:
 *
 * In essence, the browser is made taint aware by extending each string class
 * with some object to store taint information. Next, various pieces of code are
 * modified to propagate this taint information correctly.
 * The final step is to generate taint informatin at a set of predefined
 * sources and monitoring sink accesses for tainted arguments.
 * For a list of sources and sinks the taint/README.md.
 *
 * There are a couple of central data structures (classes) that are used to
 * manage taint information. These are:
 *
 *   TaintLocation      Information about where a taint operation took place
 *
 *   TaintOperation     An operation performed on tainted data. These could be
 *                      operations like substr(), replace(), concat(), ...
 *
 *   TaintFlow          Represent a flow of tainted data through the engine.
 *                      A flow is comprised of a source (e.g. location.hash)
 *                      as well as a set of operations that were performed on
 *                      the original data.
 *
 *   TaintNode          A node in a taint flow. These represent either a taint
 *                      source or an operation.
 *
 *   TaintRange         A range of tainted bytes within a string that all share
 *                      the same taint flow.
 *
 *   StringTaint        Taint information for string objects. Contain a set of
 *                      TaintRange instances.
 *
 * See the comments for each class for more details.
 *
 * Moreover, this file also provide the TaintableString base class which
 * implements some of the basic APIs for dealing with taint aware string.
 *
 * To keep this code portable we try to avoid using any Firefox specific
 * features (except assertions).

/*
 * Taint flows.
 *
 * An instance of this class represents a flow of tainted data.
 * A flow incorporates all operations that were performed on the object
 * as well as the source of the tainted data.
 *
 * For example, the following piece of JavaScript code:
 *     var a = location.hash;
 *     var b = a.split('|')[0];
 *     var c = b.substring(0, 5);
 *     var d = c.toUpperCase();
 *
 * will result in the following taint flow for |d|:
 *     1. Taint source: location.hash
 *     2. String.prototype.split('|')
 *     3. String.prototype.substring(0, 5)
 *     3. String.prototype.toUpperCase()
 *
 *
 * Internals:
 * ----------
 * In the above example, |a|, |b|, |c| and |d| all have some parts of their
 * taint flows in common. To avoid data duplication, taint flow nodes are shared
 * between different taint flows: there is just one taint node instance for each
 * of the operations in the above example.
 *
 * With this, the taint flows essentially build up a DAG with multiple root
 * nodes, one for each taint source.
 * In this DAG a taint flow represents a path from a root node to any other
 * reachable node (including the root itself).
 *
 * Right now the taint flow DAG is also a set of trees: two different nodes are
 * never merged into a new one, or, said differently, a node always has at most one
 * incoming edge. This might change in the future though and would be required
 * to correctly track the outcome of binary operations on primitive types.

/*
 * Base class for taint aware string-like objects.
 *
 * This class provides common operations for strings that carry taint
 * information.
 * Since most string classes provide direct access to their underlying character
 * buffer, this class also provides direct (writable) access to the internal
 * taint information.
 *
 * Since we don't want to modify every piece of code that deals with strings
 * anywhere in the browser, we only do the minimum amount of changes to the
 * string classes, i.e. don't modify the signature of every method that changes
 * the string to also accept a StringTaint instance. Taint aware string classes
 * will propagate taint on a "best-effort" basis instead.
 *
 * The general rule of thumbs here is that taint aware string classes will
 * propagate taint if they can (e.g. if given another taint aware string as
 * argument). If that's not possible they will at least remove any taint
 * information where appropriate (e.g. during replacement), which is usually
 * enough. In cases where the string class cannot propagate taint correctly it's
 * the callers responsibility to do so.
 *
 * Methods are provided for different coding styles to "fit into" the different
 * subsystems (mainly Gecko and Spidermonkey).
