    description: >
      This event is recorded when the memory situation is no longer low.
      The "stats" object consists of three numbers comma-delimited: 1) how
      many times a tab was unloaded 2) how many memory-pressure events
      were dispatched 3) how long we were in the low-memory situation in
      seconds
      This event was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry event
      memory_watcher.on_high_memory#stats.
