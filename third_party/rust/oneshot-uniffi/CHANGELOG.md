## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2022-09-01
### Fixed
- Handle the UNPARKING state correctly in all recv methods. `try_recv` will now not panic
  if used on a `Receiver` that is being unparked from an async wait. The other `recv` methods
  will still panic (as they should), but with a better error message.


## [0.1.4] - 2022-08-30
### Changed
- Upgrade to Rust edition 2021. Also increases the MSRV to Rust 1.60.
- Add null-pointer optimization to `Sender`, `Receiver` and `SendError`.
  This reduces the call stack size of Sender::send and it makes
  `Option<Sender>` and `Option<Receiver>` pointer sized (#18).
- Relax the memory ordering of all atomic operations from `SeqCst` to the most appropriate
  lower ordering (#17 + #20).

### Fixed
- Fix undefined behavior due to multiple mutable references to the same channel instance (#18).
- Fix race condition that could happen during unparking of a receiving `Receiver` (#17 + #20).


## [0.1.3] - 2021-11-23
### Fixed
- Keep the *last* `Waker` in `Future::poll`, not the *first* one. Stops breaking the contract
  on how futures should work.


## [0.1.2] - 2020-08-11
### Fixed
- Fix unreachable code panic that happened if the `Receiver` of an empty but open channel was
  polled and then dropped.


## [0.1.1] - 2020-05-10
Initial implementation. Supports basically all the (for now) intended functionality.
Sender is as lock-free as I think it can get and the receiver can both do thread blocking
and be awaited asynchronously. The receiver also has a wait-free `try_recv` method.

The crate has two features. They are activated by default, but the user can opt out of async
support as well as usage of libstd (making the crate `no_std` but still requiring liballoc)


## [0.1.0] - 2019-05-30
Name reserved on crate.io by someone other than the author of this crate.
