bezier flattening
-----------------
if we make sure we flatten beziers to integer y values we can avoid having to hit
the slow complex coverage path

We can probably do this by using a skia style flattener.
Normally we compute a series of line segments using partial differencing.
I think we can adjust the line towards an integer y value by having small partial differences that we can move by.
