A small and lightweight Rust library to get the current active locale on the system.

`sys-locale` is small library to get the current locale set for the system or application with the relevant platform APIs. The library is also `no_std` compatible, relying only on `alloc`, except on Linux and BSD.

Platform support currently includes:
- Android
- iOS
- macOS
- Linux, BSD, and other UNIX variations
- WebAssembly, for the following platforms:
    - Inside of a web browser (via the `js` feature)
    - Emscripten (via the `UNIX` backend)
    Further support for other WASM targets is dependent on upstream
    support in those target's runtimes and specifications.
- Windows

```rust
use sys_locale::get_locale;

let locale = get_locale().unwrap_or_else(|| String::from("en-US"));

println!("The current locale is {}", locale);
```

## MSRV

The Minimum Supported Rust Version is currently 1.48.0. This will be bumped to the latest stable version of Rust when needed.
