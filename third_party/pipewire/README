Libpipewire is a pipewire library wrapper needed to build and run Firefox with
Pipewire support on Linux (https://pipewire.org/).

Pipewire directory stores headers of pipewire-0.3 and spa-0.2 needed for build only.

The version.h file is generated by the pipewire library build from the template file `src/pipewire/version.h.in`.
