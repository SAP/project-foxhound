# This trampoline is necessary to avoid pointing into abseil-cpp's
# BUILD.gn files to pick up the definitions for absl_include_config and
# absl_define_config.  If we tried referencing these definitions in
# third_party/abseil-cpp/BUILD.gn we encounter errors finding the paths
# in import statements.

# in the libwebrtc build? (mjf)
