      Was the remote content successfully pulled? This uptake telemetry
      allows to monitor the behaviour of our clients when it comes to
      fetching data from remote servers. This helps defect-detection and
      allow observation of the proportion of success among clients and
      sources, the distribution of error causes, and its evolution over
      time.
      This event was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry event
