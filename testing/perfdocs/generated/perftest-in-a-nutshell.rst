Using the Firefox Profiler
--------------------------

The Firefox Profiler can be used to help with debugging performance issues in your code. `See here for documentation <https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/>`_ on how it can be used to better understand where the regressing code is, and what might be causing the regression. Profiles are provided on each alert summary bug from before, and after the regression (add more info).
