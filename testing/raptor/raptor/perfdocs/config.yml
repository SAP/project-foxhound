        aliases:
            - fcp
            - First Contentful Paint
            - First Contentful Composite
        description: >
            Denotes the first time the browser performs a paint that has content in it (in ms).
    "Youtube Playback Metrics":
        aliases:
            - VP9
            - H264
        matcher: VP9.*|H264.*
        description: >
            Metrics starting with VP9/H264 give the number of frames dropped, and painted.
    "First Visual Change":
        aliases:
            - FirstVisualChange
        description: The first visual change detected in the test (in ms).
    "Last Visual Change":
        aliases:
            - LastVisualChange
        description: The last visual change detected in the test (in ms).
    "Load Time":
        aliases:
            - loadtime
        description: The time it took for the page to complete loading (in ms).
    "Largest Contentful Paint":
        aliases:
            - largestContentfulPaint
            - lcp
        description: >
            The time (in ms) at which the largest piece of content on the page was rendered/painted.
    "Speed Index":
        aliases:
            - SpeedIndex
        description: >
            A metric used to denote the speed at which a page loaded. Lower values indicate faster
            pageloads. Units are in (Visually-Complete x Milliseconds). Calculated by using videos
            of the pageload which provide a measure of visual completeness. Visual completeness is
            calculated by comparing the histogram of a given frame to the final frame of the pageload.
            The SpeedIndex is calculated as the area between the curves of a constant line at y=1,
            and the graph of the visual completeness from 0ms to when visual completeness reaches
            100% (or hits the y=1 line).
    "Contentful Speed Index":
        aliases:
            - ContentfulSpeedIndex
        description: >
            Similar to SpeedIndex, except that it uses the contentfulness of a frame to determine
            visual completeness instead of the histogram differences. The contentfulness is determined
            by calculating the number of edges found in the frame. A lower number of edges detected
            gives a smaller contentfulness value (and a smaller visually complete value).
    "Perceptual Speed Index":
        aliases:
            - PerceptualSpeedIndex
        description: >
            Similar to SpeedIndex, except that it uses the structural similarity index measure (ssim)
            to determine visual completeness. This technique compares the luminance, contrast, and
            structure of the frames (a given frame vs. a final frame) to determine the completeness.
    "Estimated Frame Latency (First)":
        aliases:
            - estimatedFirstFrameLatency
        description: >
            A metric used to denote the latency on displaying the first frame of a video. Calculated
            by using videos of the pageload from which key frames are identified by matching a given
            solid RGB color with fuzz.
    "Estimated Frame Latency (Any)":
        aliases:
            - estimatedAnyFrameLatency
        description: >
            Similar to estimatedFirstFrameLatency, except that it uses all identified frames during
            video playback, normalized to be an estimate of when the first frame was displayed by
            using the expected time offset from the video itself.
