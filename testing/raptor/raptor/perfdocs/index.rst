Raptor currently supports three test types: 1) page-load performance tests, 2) standard benchmark-performance tests, and 3) "scenario"-based tests, such as power, CPU, and memory-usage measurements on Android (and desktop?).

Locally, Raptor can be invoked with the following command:

::

    ./mach raptor
