# The tests within this file are exclusively executed when `mach marionette-test`
# is called without specifying a test path. In case a specific test or manifest
# is provided, only that particular test or manifest is executed. Alternatively,
# by using a path prefix, any manifest file is recursively searched for under
# the specified path.
#
# Note: When adding a new top-level manifest file please also add a reference
# to the `MARIONETTE_MANIFESTS` entry in the appropriate `moz.build` file to
# allow the execution of tests via `mach test` and as part of the test package
# as well.
