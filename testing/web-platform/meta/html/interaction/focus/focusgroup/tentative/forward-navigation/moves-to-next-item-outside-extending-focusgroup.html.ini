  [When the focus is set on a focusgroup item which happens to also be an extending focusgroup, an arrow key press should move the focus to the next item within the extending focusgroup and skip non-focusable items. If no valid candidate is found within that extending focusgroup, the next element (in pre-order traversal) should be considered. In this case, |item4| is the valid next candidate.]
