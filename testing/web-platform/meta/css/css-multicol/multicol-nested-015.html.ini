  # Before bug 1809764, we pass this test by accident. We don't support
  # widow/orphan, and lack a granular control over choosing break points between
  # "break-before:avoid" on the inner column or "break-inside:avoid" elements
  # within the inner column. After bug 1809764, we choose to honor the
  # "break-inside:avoid" on element in the inner column.
  expected: FAIL
