# Origin isolation tests

These tests are for the proposal at
[WICG/origin-isolation](https://github.com/WICG/origin-isolation). They should
eventually move into a subdirectory of `html/` if/when that proposal merges into
the HTML Standard.

## Test filenames

The tests in `2-iframes` follow the file naming pattern

```
parent-[yes|no]-child1-[yes|no]-[designator]-child2-[yes|no]-[designator]
```

Here:

* `yes` or `no` refers to whether the `Origin-Isolation` header is set or unset.
* `designator` explains how the child differs from the parent: e.g. by being a
  subdomain, or having a different port, or both. There's also `same` if it's
  same-origin.

Other directories have variations on this, e.g. `1-iframe/` does the same thing
but for a single `child` instead of `child1` and `child2`, and `navigation/`
uses `1` and `2` to represent the two different locations the single iframe will
be navigated to.

## Coverage

Header parsing is covered by a few tests in the `1-iframe/` subdirectory, and
not duplicated to all other scenarios.
