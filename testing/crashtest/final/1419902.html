      // after the test finishes. That's because some of the window.open calls
      // trigger an exception but still open a window. Because of the
      // exception, winsToClose.push is not executed and we have no reference
      // to the window. So far there is no known way to get a reference to it.
      // It was also tried to give each opened windowed a named target, save
      // that list of targets, and use window.open("", targetname) to get a
      // reference to the window. That also doesn't work because either the
      // window.open calls never end and this page never loads, or if it does
      // load after a finite time then still some windows are left open for
      // some reason.
