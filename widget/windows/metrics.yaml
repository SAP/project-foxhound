widget:
  ime_name_on_windows:
    type: labeled_boolean
    description: >
      Locale ID and name of IME which was selected by users on Windows.
      This does NOT collect legacy IMM-IME names since we cannot get
      readable names and we do not support IMM-IME so aggressively because
      IME vendors should've already released TIP for TSF for supporting
      Windows 8 or later completely.
      This metric was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry
      scalar widget.ime_name_on_windows.

      Same data as ime_name_on_windows, but only collecting IME names
      which inserted CRLF to check whether the feature works.
