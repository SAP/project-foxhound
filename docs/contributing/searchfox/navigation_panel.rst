----------------

This section provides feature related to the VCS.

Permalink
  Convert the current document's URL into a revision-specific URL.

  This item is shown when opening a revision-agnostic URL.

  For example, if you click the item while you're on ``https://searchfox.org/firefox-main/source/js/src/jsapi.h``, It converts the current URL into ``https://searchfox.org/firefox-main/rev/3f22e78e34249196edab0a5b756394169533b8a1/js/src/jsapi.h`` (the revision ID part depends on the latest revision at that point.)

  The former URL shows the file content of the latest revision at the point of opening the page, and the latter URL shows the file content of the given revision.

  Searchfox index is updated twice a day for the main branches, and this means the file content can change twice a day.  This URL is handy for sharing the code in bug comments or in chat, where people can open the link later.

  This item has associated shortcut key :kbd:`Y`, and hitting the :kbd:`Y` key also does the same.

  Clicking the "Copy to clipboard" button next to this copies the permalink into your clipboard.
