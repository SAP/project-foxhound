# The Example Shared Rust Component

If you want to  get started with shared Rust Component development, check out the [Example component](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/tree/main/components/example).
It implements a basic TODO app as a way to show common patterns in component development and useful support crates that you can use.
Feel free to copy and paste code from there as the starting point for your component.

Also see the [Example component CLI](https://github.com/mozilla/application-services/tree/main/examples/example-cli).
Providing a command-line interface for your component is a good way to show how applications can use your app.
It also gives you a way to execute the code, which can provide a good way to test your code (alongside unit-test of course).
