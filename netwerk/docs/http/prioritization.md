# Firefox Network Scheduling and Prioritization

*Please note that this document is a first draft and is subject to further refinement and updates.*

## Scheduling
Firefox employs several techniques to orchestrate network request scheduling:

### DOM Preload Scanner (Speculative Loader)
- Runs on a background thread, scanning HTML for resource URLs to preload.
- Adds discovered resources to a speculative load queue.
- See [MDN Documentation on HTML Parser Threading (archived)](https://web.archive.org/web/20201021003137/https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/HTML_parser_threading).

### DOM Parser (Non-Speculative)
- Makes requests for elements as the DOM tree is constructed.

### Class of Service
- Categorizes requests based on context or request target. See [nsIClassOfService.idl](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f549a50b1e39b1e6bea19912d92545c4c0a06b7b/netwerk/base/nsIClassOfService.idl#7-15)
- Categories (e.g. [Leader, Normal, Follower, Speculative, etc](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f549a50b1e39b1e6bea19912d92545c4c0a06b7b/netwerk/base/nsIClassOfService.idl#69-102)) can affect both network and cache behaviours
- May defer scheduling of certain requests (e.g., trackers classified as `ClassOfService::Tail`).
- Also defines [base urgency for a request](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f2c181a7ab3bfea4d2266521e6eac713630479b3/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpHandler.cpp#794-818)

## Priority
As HTTP/1.1 does not feature a prioritization system (sequential requests), Firefox uses `supportsPriority` and `classOfService` to order requests.
With HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 utilizing a single, multiplexed connection to each host, request priority becomes crucial due to bandwidth limitations. Priority is expressed using the **Extensible Prioritization Scheme**, which includes:

- **Urgency**: Ranges from `0` (highest priority) to `7` (lowest priority). Resources with a lower numerical urgency are delivered before those with higher urgencies. For example, all resources with urgency `2` are transferred before those with urgency `3` begin.
- **Incremental**: A boolean indicating whether bandwidth should be split between this resource and others of the same urgency. The incremental flag determines if resources of the same urgency are sent sequentially (`i` not present) or incrementally (`i`).

These priorities are calculated based on the following factors:
- Resource type and its placement within the document or viewport.
- Assigned [Class of Service](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f2c181a7ab3bfea4d2266521e6eac713630479b3/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpHandler.cpp#794-818)
- Use of the [SupportsPriority](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f549a50b1e39b1e6bea19912d92545c4c0a06b7b/xpcom/threads/nsISupportsPriority.idl#8-16) interface.
- Application of PriorityHints (e.g., `fetchpriority="high"`) [adjustments](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/1e8cec3727d6e09f4af41bb3d202b7a4c326ed84/modules/libpref/init/StaticPrefList.yaml#12615-12863) which is implemented via `SupportsPriority`
- Backgrounded tabs will have their priorities lowered.
