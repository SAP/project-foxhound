   *      We need to read all headers into a buffer before calling

   *      stream if it hits MAX_STREAMS limit. In that case the steam will be
   *      queued and dequeue when neqo can again create new stream
   *      (RequestsCreatable will be called).
   *      If transaction has data to send state changes to SENDING_BODY,
   *      otherwise the state transfers to READING_HEADERS.
   *  - SENDING_BODY:
   *      The stream will be in this state while the transaction is sending
   *      request body. Http3Session::SendRequestBody will be call to give
   *      the data to neqo.
   *      After SENDING_BODY, the state transfers to READING_HEADERS.
   *  - EARLY_RESPONSE:
   *      The server may send STOP_SENDING frame with error HTTP_NO_ERROR.
   *      That error means that the server is not interested in the request
   *      body. In this state the server will just ignore the request body.
