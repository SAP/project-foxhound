# Preferences

There are a couple of preferences associated with the Remote Agent:

## Configurable preferences

### `remote.active-protocols`

Defines the remote protocols that are active. Available protocols are,
WebDriver BiDi (`1`), and CDP (`2`). Multiple protocols can be activated
at the same time by using bitwise or with the values, such as `3` for
both protocols. Defaults to `1` (WebDriver BiDi) since Firefox 129.

### `remote.events.async.enabled` (experimental)

This preference determines whether asynchronous event dispatching is used to
simulate real user input. By default, it is set to `false`, meaning events are
synthesized directly in the web page's content process, bypassing OS-level
layers like APZ (asynchronous panning and zooming).

Warning: This feature is still under development and should only be enabled for
testing purposes, not in production environments.

### `remote.experimental.enabled`

Defines if WebDriver BiDi experimental commands and events are available for usage.
Defaults to `true` in Nightly builds, and `false` otherwise.

### `remote.log.level`

Defines the verbosity of the internal logger.  Available levels
are, in descending order of severity, `Trace`, `Debug`, `Config`,
`Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, and `Fatal`.  Note that the value is
treated case-sensitively.

### `remote.log.truncate`

Defines whether long log messages should be truncated. Defaults to true.

### `remote.prefs.recommended`

By default remote protocols attempts to set a range of preferences deemed
suitable in automation when it starts.  These include the likes of
disabling auto-updates, Telemetry, and first-run UX. Set this preference to
`false` to skip setting those preferences, which is mostly useful for internal
Firefox CI suites.

The user preference file takes precedence over the recommended
preferences, meaning any user-defined preference value will not be
overridden.

### `remote.retry-on-abort`

This preference defines whether certain IPC calls from the parent process to
content processes should be retried when a browsing context is replaced due
to cross-origin navigation, or made inactive when a page moved into BFCache.

Introduced in Firefox 132, the preference is set to `true` by default.
