/* This version of libjpeg-turbo supports run-time selection of data precision,

 * time.  However, some downstream software expects the macro to be defined.
 * Since 12-bit data precision is an opt-in feature that requires explicitly
 * calling 12-bit-specific libjpeg API functions and using 12-bit-specific data
 * types, the unmodified portion of the libjpeg API still behaves as if it were
 * built for 8-bit precision, and JSAMPLE is still literally an 8-bit data
 * type.  Thus, it is correct to define BITS_IN_JSAMPLE to 8 here.
