Transforms
==========

`Transforms`_ are Python functions that can modify (or sometimes add and
remove) tasks from the graph. This section describes some of the transform
functions that are available in ``mozilla-central``.

Other Transforms
----------------

There are tons of transforms that are not documented here. Consult the source
files under `taskcluster/gecko_taskgraph/transforms`_ which provide lots of
additional detail, both in the code itself and in comments and docstrings.
