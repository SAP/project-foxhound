# binutils is needed for base toolchain builds. Ideally, it wouldn't be needed.
# libc6-i386 and lib32gcc1 are needed for wine.
# libgtk-3-0 are needed to run xpcshell during the build.
# lib32atomic1, lib32stdc++6 and lib32z1 are needed to run some 32-bits
# cpio is needed by xar (mac repackaging on linux)
# spidermonkey tests. libasound2 is needed to run xpcshell after we introduced
# the dependencies on alsa via Web MIDI.
