    description: >
      Collection of zero_byte_load events as part of the Yellow Screen of
      Death analysis. When a file is loaded synchronously, this event gets
      recorded in nsJARChannel::Open if the content length is zero. For
      asynchronous loads, this event gets recorded in onStopRequest. Note
      that when the load has been cancelled, the consumer could already
      receive some data, so this event also captures non-zero-byte loads.
      This event was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry event
      zero_byte_load.load#ftl.
