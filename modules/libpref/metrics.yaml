    type: event
    description: >
      We block certain preferences from being sent to the content process
      because they contain sensitive user data. Some preferences are
      blocked by name, others by heuristic. If one of the preferences so
      blocked is accidently accessed we want to know about it so we can
      allowlist it or refactor the access.
      This event was generated to correspond to the Legacy Telemetry event
      security.prefUsage#contentProcess.
