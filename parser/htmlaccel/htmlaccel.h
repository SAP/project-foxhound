// This file provides SIMD code for skipping over characters that
// the caller doesn't need to act upon. For example, this code can
// skip over characters that the HTML tokenizer doesn't need to handle
// specially in a given state or this code could be used to skip over
// characters that don't need to be escaped in an HTML serializer.

// ISA SUPPORT: Do not include this file unless the compilation unit is
// being compiled either for little-endian aarch64 or for x86/x86_64 with
// at least SSSE3 enabled. (We're actually not using this on 32-bit x86
// and are compiling with AVX+BMI on x86_64; see below. In the build
// system, `HTML_ACCEL_FLAGS` contains the actually-used flags.)
//
// It's probably feasible to extend this to support little-endian POWER
// by defining
// MOZ_ALWAYS_INLINE_EVEN_DEBUG uint8x16_t TableLookup(uint8x16_t table,
// uint8x16_t nibbles) {
//  return vec_perm(table, table, nibbles);
// }
// but since I don't have a little-endian POWER system to test with,
// this is left as an exercise to the reader. (The x86_64 reduction
// code should be portable to POWER10 using vec_extractm and the aarch64
// reduction code should be portable to older POWER using vec_max.)
//
// ARMv7 is deliberately not supported due to vqtbl1q_u8 being a newer
// addition to NEON.

// # General
//
// There is an entry point per combination of what characters terminate
// the acceleration loop (i.e. characters that the HTML tokenizer would not
// simply skip over). The shared implementation code is inlined into these
// FFI entry point functions, so the parametrization made inside the FFI
// functions constant-propagates through the implementation internals.
//
// The code examines 16 UTF-16 code units at a time as two 128-bit SIMD
// vectors. First, the bytes are regrouped to so that one SIMD vector
// contains the high halves of the UTF-16 code units (zeros for ASCII/Basic
// Latin) and another one contains the low halves.
//
// In the case of the low half, we mask the vector to take the low 4 bits of
// each 8-bit value and do a lookup from a lookup table contained in a SIMD
// vector. The 4 bits index into 16 lanes of the other SIMD vector such that
// we get a vector where the positions corresponding to positions of the
// original code units contain the 8-bit value looked up from by the 4-bit
// index.
//
// The lookup operation is available unconditionally on aarch64. On
// x86/x86_64, it is part of the SSSE3 instruction set extension, which is
// why on x86/x86_64 we must not call into this code unless SSSE3 is
// available. (Each additional level of compiling this code with SSE4.2,
// AVX, or AVX+BMI makes this code shorter, which presumably means more
// efficient, so instead of compiling this just with SSSE3, we compile this
// with AVX+BMI on x86_64, considering that CPUs with such capabilities
// have been available for 12 years at the time of landing this code.)
//
// The lookup table contains the loop-terminating ASCII characters in the
// positions given by their low 4 bits. For example, the less-than sign is
// U+003C, so the value 0x3C is at index 0xC (decimal 12). Positions that
// don’t correspond to a character of interest have the value 1, except lane
// 1 has the placeholder value 2. This way, characters that we don’t want to
// match anything in the lookup table get a non-matching placeholder: U+0001
// gets compared with 2 (semantically U+0002) and everything else not of
// interest gets compared with 1 (semantically U+0001) to produce a
// non-matching lane.
//
// This means that instead of comparing the vector of the low halves of the
// UTF-16 code units against multiple constant vectors each filled in all
// lanes with a given ASCII character of interest, the table lookup gives us
// one vector to compare against where each lane can have a different ASCII
// character of interest to compare with.
//
// This requires the ASCII characters of interest to have mutually distinct
// low 4 bits. This is true for U+0000, &, <, LF, CR, ", and ', but,
// unfortunately, CR, ] and - share the low 4 bits, so cases where we need
// to include a check for ] or - needs to do a separate check, since CR is
// always in the lookup table. Note that it's not worthwhile to pursue
// the low 5 bits instead when possible, because CR and - share the low
// 5 bits, too.
//
// From these operations, we get a vector of 16 8-bit mask lanes where a
// lane is 0xFF if the low 8 bits of the UTF-16 code unit matched an ASCII
// character that terminates the loop and 0x00 otherwise. We lane-wise
// compare the high halves with zero and AND the resulting mask vector
// together with the mask vector that resulted from processing the low 8
// bits to confirm which low 8 bits had 0 as the high 8 bits, i.e. the
// UTF-16 code unit really was Basic Latin.
//
// If we have a configuration that requires terminating the loop on
// surrogates, we check the vector containing the high halves of the UTF-16
// code units for surrogates (by masking certain high bits to compare them
// with a constant) and OR the resulting mask vector together with the
// vector computed above.
//
// Now we have a vector of 16 8-bit mask lanes that corresponds to the input
// of 16 UTF-16 code units to indicate which code units in the run of 16
// UTF-16 code units require terminating the loop (i.e. must not be skipped
// over). At this point, the handling diverges for x86_64 and aarch64.
//
// ## x86_64
//
// We convert the SIMD mask into bits in an ALU register. The operation
// returns a 32-bit type, but only the low 16 bits can be non-zero. If the
// integer is non-zero, the loop terminates, since some lane in the mask was
// non-zero. In this case, we return the number of trailing zeros in the
// integer. (We already know must have a non-zero bit somewhere in the low
// 16 bits, so we can’t end up counting to the high half of the 32-bit type.)
// Due to the little-endian semantics, the first UTF-16 code unit in the
// input corresponds to the least-significant bit in the integer, so when the
// first UTF-16 code unit in the input is unskippable, the least-significant
// bit in the integer is 1, so there are 0 trailing zeros, i.e. 0 skippable
// UTF-16 code units.
//
// ## aarch64
//
// We want to know if any lane is the mask is non-zero to decide whether to
// terminate the loop. If there is a non-zero lane, we want to know the
// position of the first (in the content order of the input UTF-16 text)
// non-zero lane. To accomplish these goals, we bitwise AND the mask vector
// with a vector of 16 constants. Since ANDing with a mask lane set to zero
// results in zero, we need all 16 constants to be non-zero. Yet, we need to
// be able to accommodate the possibility of first lane in content order
// being set, which means we need to compute 0 as the result. To be able to
// compute 0 but have the constants be non-zero, the constants are numbers
// that need be subtracted from 16. That is, the constant vector has lanes
// set to numbers from 16 to 1 (inclusive). We do the reduction of the
// resulting SIMD vector to an ALU integer by taking the value of the lane
// with the largest value.
//
// If no mask lane was set, the max operation results in 0, so if the
// integer is zero, the loop continues. Otherwise, we get the number of
// skippable UTF-16 code units by subtracting the integer from 16. That is,
// if the first UTF-16 unit is unstoppable, we get 16 as the max lane value
// and 16-16=0.
//
// # Alignment
//
// These functions use unaligned SIMD loads, because alignment
// doesn't matter on aarch64 CPUs or on x86_64 CPUs from the most
// recent decade or so. It's not worthwhile to add complexity for
// old CPUs.
//
// # Inlining
//
// This code was designed for inlining the public functions all the
// way to the caller for maximum LICM. However, due to
// https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/160886 the public
// functions are currently annotated _not_ to be inlined, because
// currently inlining them into the eventual caller results in
// no LICM but leaving them not-inlined results in one level of
// LICM in the leaf function.
