# Network Observer modules

The NetworkObserver module and associated helpers allow to:
- monitor network events (requests and responses)
- block requests
- throttle responses

The DevTools network-observer modules are used both by DevTools and by WebDriver BiDi, found under /remote.
Breaking changes should be discussed and reviewed both by devtools and webdriver peers.
