/**
 * This test covers all specifics of debugging WASM/WebAssembly files.
 *
 * WebAssembly is a binary file format for the Web.
 * The binary files are loaded by Gecko and machine code runs.
 * In order to debug them ThreadConfiguration's `observeWasm` is set to true,
 * only once the debugger is opened. This will set DebuggerAPI's `allowUnobservedWasm` to false.
 * Then, the engine will compute a different machine code with debugging instruction.
 * This will use a lot more memory, but allow debugger to set breakpoint and break on WASM sources.
 *
 * This behavior introduces some limitations when opening the debugger against
 * and already loaded page. The WASM file won't be debuggable.
