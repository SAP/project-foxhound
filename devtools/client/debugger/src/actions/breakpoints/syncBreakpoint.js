// Breakpoint syncing occurs when a source is found that matches either the
// original or generated URL of a pending breakpoint. A new breakpoint is
// constructed that might have a different original and/or generated location,
// if the original source has changed since the pending breakpoint was created.
// There are a couple subtle aspects to syncing:
//
// - We handle both the original and generated source because there is no
//   guarantee that seeing the generated source means we will also see the
//   original source. When connecting, a breakpoint will be installed in the
//   client for the generated location in the pending breakpoint, and we need
//   to make sure that either a breakpoint is added to the reducer or that this
//   client breakpoint is deleted.
//
// - If we see both the original and generated sources and the source mapping
//   has changed, we need to make sure that only a single breakpoint is added
//   to the reducer for the new location corresponding to the original location
//   in the pending breakpoint.
