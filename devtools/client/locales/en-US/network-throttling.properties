# LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the NetworkThrottlingMenu
# component used to throttle network bandwidth.
#
# The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
# English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
# You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
# A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
# documentation on web development on the web.

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (responsive.noThrottling): UI option in a menu to configure
# network throttling.  This option is the default and disables throttling so you
# just have normal network conditions.  There is not very much room in the UI
# so a short string would be best if possible.
responsive.noThrottling=No Throttling

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (responsive.Offline): UI option in a menu to configure
# network throttling.  The "Offline" options will make the browser behave as if
# there was no network connection available.
responsive.offline=Offline

# LOCALIZATION NOTE (throttling.profile.description): Tooltip for the throttling
# profile menu, which gives details about the hovered profile.
