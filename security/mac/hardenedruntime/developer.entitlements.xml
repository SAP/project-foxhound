<!--
     Entitlements to apply during codesigning of developer builds. These
     differ from the production entitlements in that they allow debugging of
     executables and allow dyld environment variables to be used. This set of
     entitlements is intended to be used for signing of builds used in
     automated testing or local developer builds where debugging of a signed
     build might be necessary. The com.apple.security.get-task-allow
     entitlement must be set to true to allow debuggers to attach to
     application processes but prohibits notarization with the notary service.
     dyld environment variables are used for some tests and may be useful for
     developers.
