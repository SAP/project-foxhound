///   keywords are treated as unsupported and return `Err(())`.
///
///   `overlapping_bits` is supported for bitflags where one keyword subsumes
///   other internal bits, such as `contain: size`.
///
/// * `#[typed(skip_derive_fields)]` on the type disables recursion for
///   structs and data-carrying enum variants.
///
/// * `#[css(skip)]`, `#[typed(skip)]`, or `#[typed(todo)]` on a variant cause
///   that variant to be treated as unsupported (the derived implementation
///   returns `Err(())`).
///
/// * `#[css(skip)]` on a field causes that field to be ignored during
///   reification.
///
/// * `#[css(skip_if = "...")]` / `#[typed(skip_if = "...")]` on a field
///   conditionally disables reification for that field. If the provided
///   function returns `true` for the field value, the field is ignored.
///
/// * `#[css(contextual_skip_if = "...")]` /
///   `#[typed(contextual_skip_if = "...")]` on a field conditionally disables
///   reification for that field. The provided function is called with all
///   fields in the current struct or variant. If it returns `true`, the field
///   is ignored.
///
///   Typed skip annotations override CSS skip annotations when both are
///   present.
///
/// * `#[css(keyword = "...")]` on a unit variant overrides the keyword that
///   would otherwise be derived from the Rust identifier.
///
/// * `#[css(comma)]` on the variant indicates that supported fields may reify
///   to multiple separate values. When this attribute is present, multiple
///   [`TypedValue`] items may be produced, unless
///   `#[typed(no_multiple_values)]` is also present. If multiple values are
///   not allowed and the derived implementation would produce more than one
///   item, it returns `Err(())`.
///
/// * `#[typed(no_multiple_values)]` on a variant prevents it from reifying to
///   multiple [`TypedValue`] items, even if `#[css(comma)]` is present.
///
/// * `#[css(iterable)]` on a field indicates that the field represents a list
///   of values. Each item in the iterable is reified individually by calling

///
/// * `#[css(if_empty = "...")]` on an iterable field specifies a keyword
