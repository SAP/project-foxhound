All code for this is part of the quitter project on GitHub:
https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/quitter

This is within the mozilla-extensions organization so that we can sign the .xpi.

To update code, please submit a PR to the github repo.  Once that is merged in,
a JIRA ticket (e.g. [ADDONSOPS-194][] or [ADDONSOPS-337][]) is needed to resign
the .xpi.

[ADDONSOPS-194]: https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/ADDONSOPS-194
[ADDONSOPS-337]: https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/browse/ADDONSOPS-337
