* Application-provided engines (aka app-provided): These are engines provided
  by the application to the user as part of the configurations for the user's
  locale/region.
* Application default engine: The engine automatically selected by the
  application as default, in the absence of user settings.
* Default engine: This is the engine that is the one used by default when
  doing searches from the address bar, search bar and other places. This may be
  the application default engine or an user selected engine.
* Default private engine: Same as for the default engine, but this is used by
  default when in private browsing mode.
