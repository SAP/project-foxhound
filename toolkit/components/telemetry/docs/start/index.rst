If you want to work with the telemetry code itself, for example to fix a bug, it is often helpful to start with these steps:

1. Have a look at about:telemetry to see which data is being collected and sent. Note that Origin Telemetry is missing here.
2. Increase the log level in about:config by setting toolkit.telemetry.log.level to Debug or Trace. This will show telemetry information in the browser console. To enable the browser console follow `these instructions <../../../../devtools-user/browser_console/index.html>`__.
3. Run a local telemetry receiver, e.g. `this one <https://github.com/mozilla/gzipServer>`__ and set ``toolkit.telemetry.server`` to “localhost” (Like the next preference this needs a restart.)
4. Set ``toolkit.telemetry.send.overrideOfficialCheck = true``, otherwise local debug builds will not send telemetry data. (Requires restart.)

More information about the internals can be found `here <../internals/index.html>`__.
