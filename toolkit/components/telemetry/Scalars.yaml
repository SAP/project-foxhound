    description: >
      The reason why the skeleton UI was not shown to the user. This should be
      one of the following values:
        None:
          There was no reason for not showing the skeleton UI. This should not
          be recorded.
        Ineligible:
          The user was ineligible for the skeleton UI due to information which
          should already be trivially available via telemetry (i.e., the user
          is running an OS version that doesn't support the skeleton UI.)
        Disabled:
          The registry specified "Enabled" as 0 for the skeleton UI.
        EnabledKeyDoesNotExist:
          The "Enabled" key in the registry does not exist.
        OOM:
          We encountered an allocation failure while trying to show the
          skeleton UI.
        Cmdline:
          The skeleton UI was disabled due to the presence of an unsupported
          command line argument.
        EnvVars:
          The skeleton UI was disabled due to an explicitly unsupported
          environment variable.
        FailedToOpenRegistryKey:
          We were unable to open the skeleton UI Windows registry key.
        RegistryError:
          We encountered an error trying to read/write a skeleton UI registry
          value.
        FailedLoadingDynamicProcs:
          We were unable to dynamically load one of the functions we require in
          order to show the skeleton UI.
        FailedGettingLock:
          We were unable to acquire the skeleton UI lock - this should mean
          that an existing instance of the application is already running.
        FilesystemFailure:
          Encountered some error getting the path to a file or reading from a
          particular file while trying to show the skeleton UI.
        NoStartWithLastProfile:
          The user has set up their profiles so Firefox always shows the
          profile manager during startup.
        FailedRegisteringWindowClass:
          We failed to register the window class needed to show the skeleton UI
          window.
        CorruptData:
          Clearly invalid data was found when trying to load the necessary
          information to show the skeleton UI in the right place.
        BadWindowDimensions:
          Window dimensions outside of the supported size for the skeleton UI.
        FailedGettingMonitorInfo:
          Couldn't get the monitor information when trying to display the
          skeleton UI.
        CreateWindowFailed:
          The call to CreateWindow failed.
        FailedGettingDC:
          We failed to get the HDC to draw into.
        FailedBlitting:
          We failed blitting the actual skeleton UI to the HDC.
        FailedFillingBottomRect:
          We failed filling the solid color of the main browser below the
          browser chrome.
        CrashedOnce:
          At some point the skeleton UI crashed, so we've disabled it for the
          user.
        Unknown:
          An unknown error occurred - this generally should not happen.

      The source of the RemoteSettings attachment that holds the bloom filter.
      Possible values are "dump_match", "cache_match", "remote_match", "dump_fallback", "cache_fallback", "unknown".
      "dump_match", "cache_match" and "remote_match" are expected known-good values, and means that the loaded
      bloomfilter matches the blocklist record in the RemoteSettings collection. The prefix denotes the immediate
      source of the loaded data: "dump" means packaged with the application, "remote" means a freshly downloaded
      bloomfilter, "cache" means a previously downloaded bloomfilter.
      "dump_fallback" and "cache_fallback" means that the last known bloomfilter was used, despite it not matching
      the latest record in the RemoteSettings collection. In this case the outdated bloomfilter is used as a fallback
      (e.g. because the latest version cannot be downloaded).
      "unknown" means that the bloomfilter cannot be loaded at all. This can happen if the blocklist is disabled
      via preferences or enterprise policies.
