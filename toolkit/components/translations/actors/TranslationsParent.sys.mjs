/**
 * The TranslationsParent is used to orchestrate translations in Firefox. It can

 * cycle for offering and performing translations.
 *
 * Care must be taken for the life cycle of the state management and data caching. The
 * following examples use a fictitious `myState` property to show how state can be stored.
 *
 * There is only one TranslationsParent static class in the parent process. At this
 * layer it is safe to store things like translation models and general browser
 * configuration as these don't change across browser windows. This is accessed like
 * `TranslationsParent.myState`
 *
 * The next layer down are the top ChromeWindows. These map to the UI and user's conception
 * of a browser window, such as what you would get by hitting cmd+n or ctrl+n to get a new
 * browser window. State such as whether a page is reloaded or general navigation events
 * must be unique per ChromeWindow. State here is stored in the `StatePerTopChromeWindow`
 * abstraction, like `this.getWindowState().myState`. This layer also consists of a
 * `FullPageTranslationsPanel` instance per top ChromeWindow (at least on Desktop).
 *
 * The final layer consists of the TranslationsParent actor instances, which exist per tab
 * and are recreated on page reload. Data for this layer is safe to store on the
 * TranslationsParent instance, like `this.myState`. However, any data related to the actor
 * instance that needs to persist between page loads or navigation should be stored in the
 * StatePerTab map.
 *
 * Below is an ascii diagram of this relationship.

   *   Notes: 2.x models are defined by any of two characteristics. The first characteristic is any CJK language model.

   *          The second characteristic is any "base" language model, which is larger than the "tiny" 1.x models.
