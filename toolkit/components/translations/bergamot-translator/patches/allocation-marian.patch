    Change allocation strategy for tensors
    
    When tensors grow, they would pre-emptively allocate large amounts of memory, and
    would allocate ~500mb of memory for a single translation. Adjusting this value
    down appears to fix this issue. Empirically this value keeps memory from growing too
    rapidly, and does not degrade Wasm performance.
