/**
 * nsIURLQueryStringStripper is responsible for stripping certain part of the
 * query string of the given URI to address the bounce(redirect) tracking
 * issues. It will strip every query parameter which matches the strip list
 * defined in the pref 'privacy.query_stripping.strip_list'. Note that It's
 * different from URLDecorationStripper which strips the entire query string
 * from the referrer if there is a tracking query parameter present in the URI.
 *
 * TODO: Given that nsIURLQueryStringStripper and URLDecorationStripper are
 *       doing similar things. We could somehow combine these two modules into
 *       one. We will improve this in the future.
