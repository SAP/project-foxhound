  # This is the strip list that contains the query parameters stripped by the strip-on-share feature
  # (In addition to this list, the strip-on-share feature also strips the query params from the qps list).
  # The strip list has the format:
  # domain1: {queryParams: [param1, param2, ..], topLevelSites: [www.site.de, www.site.com,...]}, domain2: {...}
  # This list will be consumed from the nsIQueryStrippingListService and
  # later be dispatched to the nsIURLQueryStringStripper in a further processed form.
