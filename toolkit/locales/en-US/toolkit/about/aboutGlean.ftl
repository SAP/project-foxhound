# An in-line drop down list precedes this string.
# Do not translate strings between <code> </code> tags.
about-glean-label-for-ping-names =
  Select from the preceding list the ping your instrumentation is in.
  If it’s in a <a data-l10n-name="custom-ping-link">custom ping</a>, choose that one.
  Otherwise, the default for <code>event</code> metrics is
  the <code>events</code> ping
  and the default for all other metrics is
  the <code>metrics</code> ping.
# An in-line check box precedes this string.
about-glean-label-for-log-pings =
  (Optional. Check the preceding box if you want pings to also be logged when they are submitted.
  You will additionally need to <a data-l10n-name="enable-logging-link">enable logging</a>.)

about-glean-label-for-controls-submit =
  Press the preceding button to tag all { -glean-brand-name } pings with your tag and submit the selected ping.

about-glean-adhoc-explanation2 =
  For more <i>ad hoc</i> testing,
  you can also determine the current value of a particular piece of instrumentation
  by opening a devtools console here on <code>about:glean</code>
  and using the <code>testGetValue()</code> API like
  <code>Glean.metricCategory.metricName.testGetValue()</code>
  for a metric named <code>metric.category.metric_name</code>.

# Do not translate strings between <code> </code> tags.
about-glean-adhoc-note =
  Please note that you are using the Glean JS API by using the devtools console.
  This means the metric category and metric name are formatted in
  <code>camelCase</code> unlike in the Rust and C++ APIs.

about-glean-profiler-explanation =
  To see a full view of all recorded metrics, you can use the { -profiler-brand-name }.
  First you must <a data-l10n-name="firefox-profiler-link">capture a performance profile</a>.

  In the performance profile you can see all the metrics collected, when they were
  collected, and exactly what values were collected. By hovering on individual markers,
  you can verify that the correct value was collected and that collection happened at the right time.
