default-agent:
  description: >
    This opt-out ping is sent from the Default Agent, which is a Windows-only
    Firefox Background Task that is registered during Firefox installation with
    the Windows scheduled tasks system so that it runs automatically every 24
    hours, whether Firefox is running or not.

    Opting out of telemetry is handled via the pref value being copied to the
    registry so that the Default Agent can read it without needing to work with
    profiles. Relevant policies are consulted as well. The agent also has its own
    pref, `default-agent.enabled`, which if set to false disables all agent
    functionality, including generating this ping.

    Each installation of Firefox has its own copy of the agent and its own
    scheduled task which shares a common `LastPingSentAt` user registry key with
    other installations. Installations race to send a single ping per 24 hour
    window per installing user. If multiple operating system-level users are all
    using one copy of Firefox, only one scheduled task will have been created and
    only one ping will be sent, even though the users might have different
    default browser settings. If multiple users have installed Firefox then each
    installing user will have a scheduled task and ping.

    Additional information for the Default Agent can be found in the
    [Default Browser Agent docs](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/mozapps/defaultagent/default-browser-agent/index.html).
